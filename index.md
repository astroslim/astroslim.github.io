__The effective radii of GC systems plotted against the total number of GCs__<br />
(_left_) Measurements for the full GC systems are shown as black symbols; the large, heavy symbols show those galaxies with well-fitted GC density profiles. The
best-fit relation is shown by the black line. The upper x-axis shows the dark matter halo mass (M200) corresponding to the
computed number of GCs in each galaxy. (_right_) Same as in the previous panel, except symbols have been color-coded
by the color difference between GC systems and their host galaxy, as indicated by the color bar on the right. The blue and red
lines show the best-fit fitted linear functions for the blue and red GC subsystems. See ยง2.4 for details on the separation of blue
and red GCs.
